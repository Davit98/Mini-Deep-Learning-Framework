# Mini-Deep-Learning-Framework

This is a mini deep learning framework that uses only pytorch’s tensor operations and python’s standard math library.

#### File descriptions

module.py -- this is the main .py file encapsulating the key components for implementing a neural network. It contains the following classes: 

* *Module* - a backbone abstract class which defines the necessary methods for training a neural network.
* *Sequential* - a container class of modules which processes input data sequentially. 
* *DenseLayer* - a class implementing fully-connected layer.
